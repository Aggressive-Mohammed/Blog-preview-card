## My process

### Built with
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
This project exposed me various properties of an SVG file.
e.g. the width, height and the ViewBox.

```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="400" height="290px" fill="none" viewBox="27 1 281 201"><g clip-path="url(#a)">
```
I also leant about the max-height and min-height CSS properties including box-showdow property.
```css
.card-container {
  background-color: var(--white);
  border: 1px solid black;
  min-height: 100%; 
  max-height: 90vh;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 1.1rem;
  box-shadow: 8px 8px;
}
```

### Continued development
The following areas will be focused on in my next project.
- CSS responsive design.
